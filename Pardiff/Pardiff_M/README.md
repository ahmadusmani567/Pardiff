PARDiff: An Order-Agnostic Autoregressive Diffusion Model for Graph Generation
Usman Ahmad Usmani, Arunava Roy, Junzo Watada

ðŸ§  Overview
PARDiff is a novel hybrid graph generative framework that integrates the strengths of autoregressive modeling and discrete diffusion processes in a unified and order-agnostic manner.

Traditional autoregressive models often depend on fixed or handcrafted node orderings, which introduces sensitivity to permutation and limits scalability. In contrast, PARDiff leverages a block-wise structural decomposition that models local dependencies via discrete diffusion while enforcing global coherence through autoregressive factorization. This structure ensures the model remains permutation-invariant, scalable to large graphs, and interpretable in its generation process.

âœ¨ Key Contributions
Hybrid Generative Framework
Combines autoregressive likelihood decomposition with a shared discrete diffusion process at the block level.

Permutation Invariance
Achieves full invariance to node reordering through permutation-consistent node ranking and block-wise masking, avoiding symmetry-breaking heuristics.

Block-wise Parallelism
Structures graphs into sequential blocks while enabling parallel denoising of each block, offering both scalability and efficiency.

Transformer-Based Backbone
Utilizes a higher-order graph transformer trained in a GPT-style causal manner, supporting flexible conditioning and expressive representation learning.

State-of-the-Art Results
Demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets including QM9, ZINC250K, and MOSES, achieving high sample quality and diversity compared to leading graph generative models.
